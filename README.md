## Lab 1: IPv4 Addressing and Routing

### Objectives

- Assigning IPv4 addresses to network interfaces.
-  Examine how loopback interfaces function and their role in network testing and management.
- Investigate how direct routing paths are generated and understand the underlying principles.
-  Learn to set up static routes, focusing on the necessary conditions for these routes to become effective.
-  Using tools like ping and tracert to assess the performance and connectivity of the network layer.
- Comparing various static routing scenarios to determine when and why each approach is appropriate.
